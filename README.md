# Board Game Recommender
This project is a web application which allows users to select from a wide variety of board games and rate each on a scale from 1 to 5.  Based on this, it will give you personalized recommendations for board games
you have not yet rated.  Internally, the recommender system uses a custom Keras model which is based on the matrix factorization approach to collaborative filtering.  The web application uses React.js on the frontend
and uses Flask to host the model on the backend.
